To move, just specify where you want to go, for example left, right, forward, or say the name of a room or object. Be careful, you may find monsters, but also treasures! You can always search the room before you enter it and fight the monsters, if you have already collected a weapon, otherwise try to escape. Good luck! What is your first move?"
